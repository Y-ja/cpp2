All I know is now
알게 됐어 나 (I know)
그동안 맨날
Always up and down (No more)
생각 또 생각
Spinnin' 'round and 'round
Changing my mind
수상해서 그렇지
이런 헛소리 (No more)
How it's supposed to be
그만해 cus it's clear (It's simple)
It's like biting an apple
Toxic lover
You're no better, 거기 숨지 말고 얼른 나와
You little demon in my storyline
Don't knock on my door, I'll see you out
And don't you know how sweet it tastes
(How sweet it tastes)
Ya don't you know how sweet it tastes
(How sweet it tastes)
Ya don't you know how sweet it tastes
Now that I'm without you
나 더는 묻지 않을래
(How sweet it tastes)
알려주지 않아도 돼
(How sweet it tastes)
Wow don't you know how sweet it tastes
Now that I'm without you
모든 게 typical
So I've been praying so hard for a miracle
부르고 있어 나의 이름을
더는 안 봐 drama it's good karma
Done scrolling thousand times
다 알고 있어 뻔한 수작일 뿐이야
완전 쉬운 공식이야
It's like biting an apple
And don't you know how sweet it tastes
(How sweet it tastes)
Ya don't you know how sweet it tastes
(How sweet it tastes)
Ya don't you know how sweet it tastes
Now that I'm without you
나 더는 묻지 않을래
(How sweet it tastes)
알려주지 않아도 돼
(How sweet it tastes)
Wow don't you know how sweet it tastes
Now that I'm without you
I won't wait, I'm feeling
My own way, I'm in it
Cause me and you are diﬀerent
So I won't stay, I'm leaving
I won't wait, I'm feeling
My own way, I'm in it
Cause me and you are diﬀerent
So I won't stay, I'm leaving
And don't you know how sweet it tastes
(How sweet it tastes)
Ya don't you know how sweet it tastes
(How sweet it tastes)
Ya don't you know how sweet it tastes
Now that I'm without you
나 더는 묻지 않을래
(How sweet it tastes)
알려주지 않아도 돼
(How sweet it tastes)
Wow don't you know how sweet it tastes
Now that I'm without you
Toxic lover
You're no better, 거기 숨지 말고 빨리 나와
You little demon in my storyline
Don't knock on my door 너 얼른 나가버려
Toxic lover
You're no better, 거기 숨지 말고 얼른 나와
You little demon in my storyline
Don't knock on my door, I'll see you out
